 // What is the output

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{    
         int x, y = 1;
         x = 10;
         if (x != 10 && x / 0 == 0)
            cout << y;
         else
             cout << ++y;
} 


// Correct Answer =  2 
 

/* Even though you get the output as '2', you'll also get a "division by zero" warning.
The reason you only get a warning but not an error is short-circuit evaluation. 
In the if statement, once the first condition (x != 10) is evaluated to be false,
then the second condition (x / 0 == 0) is not even executed, 
because the result of the overall condition (x != 10 && x / 0 == 0) will be false. 
Even if the second condition were true, it would not change the overall result of the two conditions.

However, if the value of x or the first condition itself is changed so that it evaluates to true, then you will get an error because , 
in that case the second condition would also be checked (or executed) */
